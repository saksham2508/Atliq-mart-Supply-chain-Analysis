## Project Overview
Atliq Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer in Gujarat, faced **customer churn risks** as some key clients did not renew annual contracts due to **poor delivery performance**.  
The management wanted a **daily tracking system** for supply chain KPIs to identify service gaps and act quickly.  

This project delivers an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that monitors **On-Time (OT%), In-Full (IF%), OTIF%, Line Fill Rate (LIFR%), and Volume Fill Rate (VOFR%)**, with actionable insights for improving supply chain efficiency and retaining key customers.

## Dataset & Data Model
The data was modeled into a **Star Schema** using fact and dimension tables:  

- **dim_customers** ‚Üí Customer details (ID, Name, City)  
- **dim_products** ‚Üí Product details (ID, Name, Category)  
- **dim_date** ‚Üí Calendar table (Date, Month, Week No.)  
- **dim_targets_orders** ‚Üí Target OT%, IF%, OTIF% per customer  
- **fact_order_lines** ‚Üí Line-level order details (Qty Ordered, Delivered, Delivery Dates)  
- **fact_orders_aggregate** ‚Üí Aggregated order-level KPIs (On-Time, In-Full, OTIF flags)

## Key Metrics
- **OT% (On-Time %):** Orders delivered on/before agreed date  
- **IF% (In-Full %):** Orders delivered in full quantity  
- **OTIF%:** Orders delivered both On-Time and In-Full  
- **LIFR% (Line Fill Rate):** % of product lines fulfilled  
- **VOFR% (Volume Fill Rate):** % of total quantities delivered
